https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LyziNdFlew

direct wiring:
a single pin per pin 

matrix diode 
use diode for n key rol over ghosting 
diods only for rows 
coloums dont have diodes 

ye I give up on esey eda 
nothign works 

I am switching to ki cad we will see if my laptop can run or not

got a basic idea on how the keyboard is going to look

- use uart prototcol between module for data transfer
- can remapp any pins to work for rx and tx
- set rows as output 
- set colloums to input
- connect with with magnet pogo pin connection 
- probs need ribbion cabels 
- need to check how to make the 90deg connections
- basic excali draw layout with eveything I need 
- just need to finnalise the exact pins
